<h2>About</h2>
<p>FreshersTV is an annual collaborative broadcast run by the National Association of Student Television (NaSTA) and a host station. It's year the host station is LA1:TV from Lancaster University. The broadcast links up student TV stations from across the country to showcase the best of their freshers' week activities and content. Freshers' week is the most important week of the year for many stations as it is the main recruitment opportunity for new members as well as a chance to produce lots of content.</p>
<p>This year the broadcast will also feature performances from the best student groups in Lancaster alongside the freshers week highlights. As this years event is being hosted in the Nuffield Theatre at Lancaster University it is the ideal opportunity to include performances from music and dance groups, game show challenges and other activities along side the freshers week highlights.</p>
